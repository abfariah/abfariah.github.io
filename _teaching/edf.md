In charge of an internal reinforcement learning training program open to researchers and engineers at EDF R&D. The program covers fundamental concepts, algorithms, and practical applications of reinforcement learning in industrial settings. The course follows Emmanuel Rachelson's MVA class [material](https://github.com/abfariah/RL_Class).

Approximate dynamic programming

* Markov Decision Processes
* Value iteration
* Q-learning
* Deep Q-Networks

Policy Gradient methods
======

* Policy gradient theorem
* REINFORCE
* Actor-Critic methods
* Proximal Policy Optimization
