Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. candidate at EDF R&D and CNAM in Paris, working at the intersection of reinforcement learning and combinatorial optimization. My research focuses on model-based planning for mixed-integer linear programming and the integration of learning methods into exact optimization pipelines. I am broadly interested in reinforcement learning theory, generative modeling, and the foundations of optimization.
